            <h2>Folder Organization</h2>
            <p>One of the most common yet effective practices is to have a <strong>folder</strong> containing your html files, <br>
            and subfolders for relevant media. (e.g Images, Videos, Music etc.)</p>
            <p>When sourcing a media file from a subfolder, be sure to use the forward slash: '/' <br>
            For example, to use the image bacon.jpg from the subfolder <strong>images</strong>,
            write &lt;img src="images/bacon.jpg" alt = "... and so on"&gt;. </p>

            <h2>Making Good Images</h2>
            <section id = "width">
                <h3>Making it fit</h3>
                <p>Images are tricky to implement in html - they come in all shapes and sizes, and don't always fit on the web page. <br>
                A good way to make sure an image fits onto any screen and keeps its proportions is with the <strong>width</strong> attribute in the &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>
                <p>For example, &lt;img src = "tower.png" alt = "" width = "50%"&gt; makes sure the image tower.png always takes up half the width of the browser. <br>
                <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, this feature has been removed in HTML5 and should hence only be done in CSS. Not HTML. 
                So alternatively, set width = "500":</p>
                <p>Below is a screenshot from Hollow Knight: Silksong by Team Cherry, displayed by an img tag:</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="imgs/tower.png" alt="Old tower in a forest of clover plants" title = "tower.png" width= "500">
                    <figcaption>Screenshot from Hollow Knight: Silksong by Team Cherry (tower.png). The html used to display this image: <br>
                    &lt;img src="imgs/tower.png" alt="Old tower in a forest of clover plants" title = "tower.png" width= "500"&gt;</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </section>
            <br>
            <section id = "alt">
                <h3>The alt attribute</h3>
                <p>The <em>alt</em> attribute of an &lt;img&gt; tag is also particularly important. <br>
                A good alt tag should be short, concise, and purposeful. Convey meaning, not description!</p>
                <br>
                <p>For example, an alt of "A photo I took of three stars shining in the night sky." <br>
                is better than "Picture of three stars shining in the night sky."</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "star.png" alt="A photo I took of the night sky on Mid Autumn's eve." width = "50">
                    <figcaption>A good alt</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "star.png" alt="Picture of three stars shining in the night sky." width = "50">
                    <figcaption>A bad alt</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>In another example, an alt of "" is perfectly fine for a decorative image-but still necessary, so don't skip the alt.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "deco.png" alt="">
                    <figcaption>Just for decoration</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Notice how the small broken image icon doesn't show up here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Last but not least: If the alt is too long (e.g infographics), it is a good idea to make the alt a link to a separate page <br>
                 with the full information, instead of a verbose paragraph.</p>

            <h2>Writing Hyperlinks</h2>
            <section id = "References">
                <h3>href: Hyperlink reference</h3>
                <p>There are three main types of hyperlink reference: absolute, relative and embedded links.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Absolute</em> reference involves the <strong>full url</strong>: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;a href="https://orgmode.org"&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Always use absolute references when you link to an <strong>external page</strong>, i.e a site that you don't own.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Relative</em> reference involves only the specific file from the <em>same site</em>: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;a href="dog.html"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;a href="MyFolder/plant.html"&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use relative references when you link to <em>different parts of your own site.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Embedded</em> reference are links to different parts of the <strong>same page</strong>.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Return to <a href = #top>top</a>: &lt;a href="#top"&gt; <br>
                                Note: for this to work, the top tag of the page must have an attribute id set to "top". <br>
                                Here, I did so with the body tag: <br>
                                &lt;body id="top"&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Go to <a href = #Images>Making Good Images</a>: &lt;a href="#images"&gt; <br>
                                Similarly, the &lt;section&gt; tag I used for Images has been set with the id = "Images": <br>
                                &lt;section id="Images"&gt;
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Embedded links are useful for <em>quick site navigation</em>, as demonstrated by the examples mentioned above.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>The target attribute</h3>
                <p>The target attribute allows us to control where we want a link to open. <br>
                The two most prominent uses are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        _self: <br>
                        The default value. Opens the new page in the current frame (which opens it in the current window in most cases)
                        <figure>
                            <a href="imgs/chasm.png" target="_self">

                    </li>

                        _blank: <br>
                        Opens the link in a new window.

            <h2>Making things Accessible</h2>
            <p>Accessible HTML is HTML organized for the benefit of the widest possible audience, <strong>including people with disabilities</strong>. <br>
            Below are two good tips for writing accessible HTML:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Good Semantics</h3>
                        <p>Semantics are <em>meaning</em>. They are crucial to all code, yet easily the most broken convention in writing accessible HTML.<br>
                        Different tags have different meaning (semantics) in HTML: It is important to know when to use which. For example: </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src = "imgs/button-notSemantic.png" alt = "Using the HTML div tag to wrap the text 'Play Video'." width = "200">
                            <figcaption>The &lt;div&gt; tag has no semantic meaning; from it we know nothing about what "Play Video" is meant to represent. <br> 
                            This is <em>bad practice</em>.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <figure>
                            <img src = "imgs/button-Semantic.png" alt = "Using the HTML button tag to wrap the text 'Play Video'." width = "200">
                            <figcaption>The &lt;button&gt; tag has semantic meaning: it clearly tells us that the text "Play Video" will display on a clickable button. <br>
                            This is a <em>semantic</em> tag &mdash; they convey the <strong>meaning</strong> and <strong>underlying purpose</strong> of contained text.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Another commonly seen bad practice is using line breaks, i.e &lt;br&gt;, to separate headings and paragraphs.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src = "imgs/paragraph-notSemantic.png" alt = "Using line breaks to separate paragraphs, and the HTML span tag to style a heading." height = "200">
                            <figcaption>Both the &lt;span&gt; and &lt;br&gt; tags exist for the sole purpose of formatting. They <strong>do not</strong> convey anything about the meaning of the contained text. <br>
                            Is "My heading" just a piece of stylized text, or the actual heading of the document? It is not clear. <br>
                            This HTML is hard to debug, and would be difficult to understand for visually impaired people.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <figure>
                            <img src = "imgs/paragraph-Semantic.png" alt = "Using the HTML heading and paragraph tags to structure a body of text." height = "200">
                            <figcaption>The &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags clearly represent the hierarchy and structure of the text. <br>
                            The HTML "says" that the first line is the <em>highest level heading</em>, and that the next two lines are <em>separate paragraphs.</em> <br>
                            It is <strong>shorter</strong> and far more <strong>concise</strong> than the previous HTML, which "says" the first line is stylized to be bigger, followed by two line breaks, followed by another line...and so on.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </section>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Clear Language</h3>
                        <p>Next concerns not the way we use HTML tags, but how we write the text within. <br>
                        It is important to make sure the language of our site is simple and easy to understand for most people. <br>
                        Four important guidelines for writing clearly are as followes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Don't use unnecessarly slang terms, or overtly complex language. <br>
                                For example, saying "This movie was a <em>great watch</em>" is better than saying "This movie was <strong>fire</strong>".</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Don't use dashes, i.e &ndash; and &mdash;, if you can avoid it. <br>
                                For example, instead of saying "1&ndash;10", say "1 to 10".</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Expand abbreviations once or twice before fully abbreviating them. <br>
                                For example, start with "World Health Organization", then use the abbreviation <abbr title = "World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> with the HTML &lt;abbr&gt; tag, <br>
                                i.e &lt;abbr title = "World Health Organization"&gt;WHO&lt;&#47;abbr&gt;
                            </li>
                        </ol>

            <h2>Bonus tutorial: the video tag</h2>
            <p>Thanks for reading my site! As a bonus for coming this far, here is a tutorial on how to use the video tag.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "imgs/video-tag.png" alt = "The HTML video tag containing a HTML source tag and the attributes width, height and autoplay." title = "video-tag" height = "70">
                <figcaption>HTML video tag designed to display a video that autoplays on a website. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            To use the video tag, you can first set the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> attributes to your desired values in the start tag. <br>
            This works similarly to img, where the width and height are automatically scaled to fit the video's original resolution if one is given but the other is not. <br>
            After the width and height attributes you can add the keyword attribute <em>autoplay</em> or <em>muted</em> to play the video automatically, or with no volume respectively. <br>
            The <em>controls</em> attribute makes video controls visible to the user. The <em>loop</em> attribute makes the video repeat its duration endlessly.
            All four aforementioned attributes are special in that they <strong>do not</strong> require you to assign a value with the equal sign.
            </p>
            <p>
            Between the start and end tag is the self-closing source tag: <br>
            Inside this you need to use the <em>src</em> attribute to indicate the <strong>path to the file</strong>, <br>
            and the <em>type</em> attribute to indicate the <strong>filetype</strong>, which in this case is "video/mp4". <br>
            </p>
            <p>The result of the above HTML has been displayed below. <br>
            Additionally, the <em>aria-label</em> has been used in the video start tag to provide some alternative text, as the video tag has no <em>alt</em> attribute.</p>
            <figure>
                <video width = "320" autoplay muted controls loop aria-label = "Hornet learns a new word with Shakra.">
                    <source src = "vids/poshanka.mp4" type = "video/mp4">
                </video>
                <figcaption>A gameplay clip from Hollow Knight: Silksong by Team Cherry. <br>
                Hovering over the video allows you to access video controls. The video is muted and plays automatically on loop, but you can modify the settings here.</figcaption>
